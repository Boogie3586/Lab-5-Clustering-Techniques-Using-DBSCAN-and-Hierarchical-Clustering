# MSCS_634_Lab_5

## Purpose
This lab demonstrates clustering techniques using the Wine dataset. Both Hierarchical and DBSCAN clustering algorithms were applied to explore natural groupings in the data.

## Key Insights
- Hierarchical clustering effectively visualizes nested data structure via dendrograms.
- DBSCAN identifies clusters with arbitrary shapes and detects noise points.
- Parameter choice (n_clusters for Hierarchical, eps/min_samples for DBSCAN) significantly impacts results.

## Challenges and Decisions
- Selecting DBSCAN parameters required experimentation.
- PCA was used to reduce dimensions for plotting cluster separations.
